# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This repository contains a **Machine Learning project** based on the famous **Titanic dataset**.  
The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using features such as age, sex, class, and other attributes.

## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading**  
   Load the Titanic dataset (CSV file from Kaggle or other sources).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Visualize distributions  
   - Understand feature correlations  

3. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Normalize/scale numerical features  
   - Split dataset into training and testing sets  

4. **Model Training**  
   Different machine learning models are applied (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, etc.).

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   - Accuracy score  
   - Confusion matrix  
   - Cross-validation  

6. **Prediction**  
   Predict survival status on unseen data.
